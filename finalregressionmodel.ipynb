        "\n",
        "While I had prior experience with binary classification and regression, this assignment introduced me to new techniques and insights, especially in multiclass classification. A significant “aha!” moment was not only in implementing a multiclass classification model but also in learning how to interpret its results thoroughly and make necessary adjustments to improve accuracy. In particular, I discovered that modifying the structure of a neural network, such as increasing the number of layers, can enhance model accuracy. This hands-on experience in tweaking model architecture gave me a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Huh? (Confusions)\n",
        "\n",
        "Building the model posed several challenges, particularly when it came to finding the right balance in model architecture. For example, I found it confusing at times to determine how many layers and neurons to include in the neural network for the multiclass classification model. The trial-and-error process required to achieve an optimal configuration was time-consuming, and interpreting the impact of each change wasn’t straightforward. Additionally, while tuning the model, I occasionally encountered issues in understanding why certain adjustments didn’t yield expected improvements, which led to some confusion around the relationship between model complexity and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cool!\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most exciting parts of the project was seeing how adjusting the neural network’s structure directly impacted model accuracy. It was particularly rewarding to increase the number of layers in the multiclass model and observe a tangible improvement in performance. This felt empowering, as I could use my understanding of neural networks to make practical adjustments that enhanced the model’s predictive power. Knowing that these small changes had a measurable effect was motivating and validated the effort I put into fine-tuning the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gotcha! (Changed Perspective)\n",
        "\n",
        "Before this assignment, I viewed model building as a somewhat rigid process, where once a model type was chosen, the primary focus was just running it on data. This assignment shifted my perspective by showing me how much flexibility and control I have within each model, especially with neural networks, where the architecture itself can be fine-tuned to yield better results. This experience made me appreciate the iterative nature of model building and emphasized the importance of making deliberate choices in tuning model parameters and architecture, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary\n",

        "Overall, this assignment taught me valuable lessons in multiclass classification and model fine-tuning. I’ve not only strengthened my understanding of binary classification and regression but have also developed skills in interpreting complex model results and making architectural adjustments to optimize performance. Applying these techniques in the future will allow me to adapt models to meet the specific requirements of each project. This experience has enhanced my ability to approach machine learning tasks more systematically, with a keen focus on model structure and performance tuning for improved outcomes."
